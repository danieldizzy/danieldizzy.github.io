Welcome to 2025! It's been quite a journey since my last post in 2017. The cybersecurity landscape has evolved dramatically, and I wanted to share some thoughts on where we are now and what's ahead.

## What's Changed Since 2017

### The Threat Landscape
- **AI-Powered Attacks**: We're seeing sophisticated AI-driven phishing and social engineering attacks
- **Supply Chain Security**: The focus has shifted significantly to securing the entire software supply chain
- **Cloud Security**: With widespread cloud adoption, new security paradigms have emerged
- **Zero Trust Architecture**: The "never trust, always verify" approach has become mainstream

### New Technologies and Challenges
- **Container Security**: Docker, Kubernetes, and container orchestration security
- **DevSecOps**: Security integrated into the development lifecycle
- **IoT Security**: The explosion of connected devices brings new attack vectors
- **Quantum Computing**: Preparing for post-quantum cryptography

## Personal Updates

As a **Wireless Compliance Test Engineer** and **part-time Penetration Tester**, I've been focusing on:

- Advanced wireless security protocols (WPA3, 5G security)
- Compliance frameworks and their evolution
- Hands-on penetration testing methodologies
- Continuous learning and skill development

## What's Next for This Blog

I'm planning to revive this blog with regular content covering:

1. **Technical Tutorials**: Step-by-step guides for security tools and techniques
2. **Industry Analysis**: Thoughts on emerging threats and technologies
3. **Compliance Insights**: Real-world experiences with security compliance
4. **Tool Reviews**: Honest reviews of security tools and platforms
5. **Career Development**: Tips for cybersecurity professionals

## Current Learning Focus

- **Cloud Security**: AWS, Azure, and GCP security best practices
- **Threat Hunting**: Advanced techniques for proactive threat detection
- **Incident Response**: Modern IR methodologies and tools
- **Automation**: Security automation and orchestration (SOAR)
