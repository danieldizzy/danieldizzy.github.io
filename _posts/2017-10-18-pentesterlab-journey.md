This will be my first post in 2017 ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜© its not like i had several post earlier, but hopefully I can do much better from now.

Enough with the bla bla bla, a couple of months ago I by chance found my first bug in some web application [Japanese Groupon](https://www.groupon.jp/) however, as a result of my poor bug reporting, I did not receive any feedback from the admins(they were just bad). Although its very difficult to find bugs recently and most bug-bounty programs are very competitive, its never too late to show up for the party.

This leads to the beginning of further improving my understanding in web-penetration testing. I have followed the free courses on PentesterLab and also tried a free three-month subscription of Pluralsight web-app testing course and it was interesting. I decided to complete the PentesterLab free exercise first before investing some financial resources into the subscription based option. I did not mention its not very expensive, [Students Subscription for 3 months @ $34.99 instead of $ 59.97](https://pentesterlab.com/pro/students) considering I don't spend money on Coffee, (self brewed saves a lot). I have decided to work through the free boot-camp offered on the site, the first few weeks offered some basic tasks and introduction to get students familiar with Web-App testing from weeks 5 onwards seemed to involve actual web app exercises that will help you improve

I had been thinking I want to improve my understanding of web penetration testing, and I had heard good things about the learning content offered by PentesterLab, and as Iâ€™m a poor student, decided to work through the free boot-camp offered on PentesterLab.
